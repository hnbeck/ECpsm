# ECpsm
A new implementation of Phenomenon Signal Model according the paper https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.09996 in Mercury

# Architecture
The application will have three components at the end: 
-  a logic part executing rules
-  a visualization part showing results of the executed rule system
-  a graph data base part storing something like tiples, owl, ontology related things

# Visualisation
As visualization engine the UnrealEngine 5 will be used. It is planed that a VR device for this can be used, too.

# Graph DB
No details available yet

# Usage
The system is compiled and intended to use under Windows 10/11.
There are two scripts (powershell)

-  initMCApp.ps1 -> cleans up every files except the sources
-  pmake.ps1 -> build the system (very trivial at the moment)

# Remarks
There is also an TCL script. Its purpose is mostly for testing.

Details will follow
